# Test-Driven Development

## Philosophy

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details — code can change entirely; the tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification: "user can checkout with valid cart" names a capability, not a mechanism.

The heuristic that sorts good from bad in one move: **a test that breaks under a refactor when behavior hasn't changed is bound to the implementation** — it tests _how_, not _what_. Good tests survive the refactor because they never see internal structure.

[tests.md](tests.md) has the good/bad taxonomy with Python examples and the faking rules; architecture vocabulary (module, interface, seam, depth) lives in [../_shared/LANGUAGE.md](../_shared/LANGUAGE.md).

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** Bulk-written tests encode _imagined_ behavior, not actual behavior — they test the shape of things (signatures, data structures) rather than what callers care about, and they commit you to test structure before you understand the implementation.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED->GREEN: test1->impl1
  RED->GREEN: test2->impl2
  ...
```

One test -> minimal implementation -> repeat. Each test responds to what the previous cycle taught you. (This is the same rule as the AGENTS.md Workflow section — the skill is the long form.)

## Workflow

### 1. Plan

If the project keeps domain docs, use the `CONTEXT.md` glossary so test names and interface vocabulary match the project's language, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Before writing code, infer the public interface and highest-priority behavior from the request, existing code, glossary, and ADRs. Ask the user only when a material ambiguity remains; otherwise state any assumption briefly and proceed. List behaviors, not implementation steps.

For a non-trivial design (new module, schema, public API, algorithm choice), state 2–3 candidate approaches with trade-offs first — AGENTS.md Workflow rule. For a full interactive design session, the `interview` skill is the heavyweight version.

### 2. Tracer bullet

Before editing production code, write ONE test for ONE observable behavior and run the narrowest useful command:

```
RED:   write test for first behavior -> watch it fail
GREEN: minimal code to pass -> watch it pass
```

"Minimal code" is the AGENTS.md Laziness ladder: climb to the first rung that holds (reuse → stdlib → native → installed dep → one line), and write nothing past what the test demands.

Valid RED means the intended test was collected and executed, and the failure points to the missing or incorrect behavior. Collection, import, syntax, fixture, and unrelated setup failures mean the test is broken, not RED.

### 3. Incremental loop

For each remaining behavior: RED -> GREEN. Rules:

- One test at a time; only enough code to pass it; don't anticipate future tests.
- Iterate with `uv run pytest --last-failed -x`.
- Collapse near-duplicate cases with `@pytest.mark.parametrize` instead of copy-pasting tests.
- Reach for `hypothesis` when the unit is a parser, serializer, or numeric edge-case farm.

### 4. Refactor

Only at GREEN, never while RED. Candidates:

- Duplication -> extract function/class
- Long functions -> private helpers (tests stay on the public interface)
- Shallow modules -> combine or deepen ([../_shared/LANGUAGE.md](../_shared/LANGUAGE.md))
- Feature envy -> move logic to where the data lives
- Primitive obsession -> introduce a value type
- Problems the new code reveals in existing code

Run tests after each refactor step. Before the full verify loop, confirm tests cover every public operation or observable branch intentionally changed. Do not add tests for internal paths solely because they were edited. After the change set, run the full verify loop from AGENTS.md (`ruff check --fix` -> `ruff format` -> `ty check` -> `pytest`).

## Bug fixes

Enter the loop at RED: reproduce the bug with a failing test before touching the fix — no exceptions (AGENTS.md Workflow rule). If you can't reproduce it, stop TDD and switch to the `debug` skill; come back with its minimised repro as your first test.

## Checklist per cycle

```
[ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
[ ] Test uses public interface only
[ ] Test would survive an internal refactor
[ ] RED collected and executed, then failed for the target behavior
[ ] Code is minimal for this test
[ ] No speculative features added
```
